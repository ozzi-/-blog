# µblog
Easy to setup, integrate into existing pages and customize micro blog. Requires PHP only (no database needed).

# Adding content
Blog posts are stored as html files, so you can use whatever mark-up you like.
The first line of the file is interpreted as the post title. The order of the posts is managed by the file names, that's why all files should be named like the following {incrementing number}.html

# Configuration
blogconfig.php contains three variables, thats all it takes setting up the blog.

# Changing the design
In the templates folder you can tweak µblog design easily.

# Live demo
Everybody likes live demos!
